Description: Omicron is a desert planet with mountain ranges, lakes, plains and rugged terrain. The atmosphere is relatively thin and non breathable. However, oxygen can be generated from the water of the lakes. [c][e0e020]Be warned, choosing this planet as the survival start is recommended for experienced players only.[-][/c]
